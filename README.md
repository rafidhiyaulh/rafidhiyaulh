# Hey, I'm Rafi 👋

Final-year student at ITB, mostly working with data and occasionally pretending to understand AI.

I like making sense of messy datasets, automating repetitive tasks, and building things that (hopefully) help people make better decisions.

When I'm not debugging, you'll find me on the tennis court, shooting hoops, or with my nose in a book.

## 🔍 Currently curious about
- Hybrid ML models for time-series prediction
- How data drives business strategy and decision-making
- Building products that actually solve real problems

## 🛠️ Usually working with
Python · SQL · Pandas · Power BI · A lot of trial and error
