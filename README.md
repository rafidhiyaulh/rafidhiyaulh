# Hey, I'm Rafi 👋

Final-year student at ITB, mostly working with data and occasionally pretending to understand AI.

I like making sense of messy datasets, automating repetitive tasks, and building things that (hopefully) help people make better decisions.

When I'm not debugging, you'll find me on the tennis court, shooting hoops, or with my nose in a book.
